# ERC-1155 Multi-Token Standard

**Overview:**

ERC1155 allows managing multiple token types (fungible and non-fungible) within a single contract, offering improved efficiency over separate ERC20 or ERC721 contracts.

### Core Components

1. **Token Identification**:
    - Each token type has a unique `uint256` identifier.
    - A single ID can represent either fungible or non-fungible tokens.
2. **Balance Tracking**:
    - Mapping: `mapping(uint256 => mapping(address => uint256)) private _balances;`
    - Tracks balances of each token type for each address.
3. **Approval System**:
    - Operator approval: `mapping(address => mapping(address => bool)) private _operatorApprovals;`
4. Total Supply of each token ID:
    - Total supply of each token ID: `mapping(uint256 => uint256) private _totalSupply;`

### Core Functions

1. `balanceOf(address account, uint256 id) → uint256`
2. `balanceOfBatch(address[] accounts, uint256[] ids) → uint256[]`
3. `setApprovalForAll(address operator, bool approved)`
4. `isApprovedForAll(address account, address operator) → bool`
5. `safeTransferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 id, uint256 amount, bytes data)`
6. `safeBatchTransferFrom(address from, address to, uint256[] ids, uint256[] amounts, bytes data)`

### Token Minting (Internal)

```solidity
function _mint(address to, uint256 id, uint256 amount, bytes memory data) internal virtual {
    require(to != address(0), "ERC1155: mint to the zero address");

    address operator = _msgSender();
    _balances[id][to] += amount;
    emit TransferSingle(operator, address(0), to, id, amount);

    _doSafeTransferAcceptanceCheck(operator, address(0), to, id, amount, data);
}
```

### Batch Operations

ERC1155 supports efficient batch operations:

```solidity
function _mintBatch(address to, uint256[] memory ids, uint256[] memory amounts, bytes memory data) internal virtual {
    require(to != address(0), "ERC1155: mint to the zero address");
    require(ids.length == amounts.length, "ERC1155: ids and amounts length mismatch");

    address operator = _msgSender();

    for (uint256 i = 0; i < ids.length; i++) {
        _balances[ids[i]][to] += amounts[i];
    }

    emit TransferBatch(operator, address(0), to, ids, amounts);

    _doSafeBatchTransferAcceptanceCheck(operator, address(0), to, ids, amounts, data);
}
```

### URI for Metadata

```solidity
function uri(uint256 id) public view virtual returns (string memory) {
    return _uris[id];
}
```

### Uniqueness and Fungibility

- Single contract manages both fungible and non-fungible tokens.
- Token IDs determine uniqueness:
    - Fungible tokens: Multiple tokens can share an ID.
    - Non-fungible tokens: Each token has a unique ID with a total supply of 1.

### Differences from ERC721

1. **Multiple Token Types**: Manages multiple token types in one contract.
2. **Batch Operations**: Native support for efficient batch transfers and queries.
3. **Fungibility**: Supports both fungible and non-fungible tokens.
4. **Approval System**: Uses operator approvals instead of per-token approvals.
5. **Gas Efficiency**: Generally more gas-efficient for large numbers of token types.
